1.1.;Con:;Hate speech is wrong, from an ethical point of view, and should therefore be made illegal.
1.1.1.;Con:;In some cases, something labeled 'hate speech' can be morally right. Some things need to be said, and staying silent could be far more dangerous and even immoral than speaking out.
1.1.1.1.;Con:;"Hate speech is directed at a person or group of people, not at an action or activity. For example saying ""anal sex holds a higher risk of transmitting STI's"" is correct and not hate speech, saying ""Homosexuality is wrong because anal sex holds a higher risk of transmitting STI's"" is hate speech."
1.1.1.1.1.;Pro:;"Opinion tangentially connected to fact is not in itself fact; and facts are rarely labeled hate speech unless they are presented in a context to engender hate."
1.1.1.1.1.1.;Con:;Many times in many platforms across scientific fields [facts are labeled as hate speech](https://www.mindingthecampus.org/2013/07/05/how_hate_facts_kill_scientific/).
1.1.2.;Con:;Government control over speech is wrong, as is outlawing dissent, and by the same logic, controlling speech is wrong and should therefore be illegal \(which is why it is\).
1.1.2.1.;Con:;Dissent is already often met with legal repercussions for the dissenters. Protesters frequently face jail time or arrest records for acts of civil disobedience in protest.
1.1.3.;Con:;Government cannot and should not make every morally wrong act illegal.
1.1.3.1.;Pro:;To legislate and enforce the illegality of every immoral act would require a totalitarian police state.
1.1.3.1.1.;Pro:;Legal, state-based sanctions crowd out private, community-based sanctions. We need more of the latter, and fewer of the former.
1.1.3.1.1.1.;Con:;Community based sanctions \(such as [ostracization](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/ostracization)\) have been shown to be less effective, and more detrimental to the offender as they do not have methods of appeal, or time constraints.
1.1.3.1.2.;Con:;The judicial system is already unable to prosecute every illegal act, that does not mean we should abandon laws or working towards a better system.
1.1.3.2.;Con:;Every morally wrong act that has the ability to to hurt others should be illegal in order protect other citizens.
1.1.3.2.1.;Con:;Hate speech does not hurt anyone. It can only hurt people's feelings, which need not be protected.
1.1.3.2.1.1.;Con:;[Psychological harm](https://www.kialo.com/should-hate-speech-be-legally-protected-10134/10134.0=10134.1-10134.3-10134.300-10134.688/-10134.688)
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.;Con:;Speech cannot harm anyone directly, only the concrete consequences it provokes can.
1.1.3.2.1.1.1.1.;Pro:;Hate speech consequences are actions perpetrated by those who felt sympathethic with the speech in the first place. Thus, limiting sympathy by exposing hate speech - not censoring it - has the priority.
1.1.3.2.1.1.2.;Con:;"It is only harm as long as it is allowed. Interpretation is entirely subject to the ""victim"" and is never uniform."
1.1.3.2.1.2.;Con:;But it can cause social disorder, and divide society.
1.1.3.3.;Pro:;Laws are there to protect society, not to reflect individual morality.
1.1.3.4.;Con:;Laws should reflect the will of society. If society believes an act is immoral, the government should legislate to prevent people engaging in such an act.
1.1.3.4.1.;Con:;Laws exist to protect the rights of all citizens, even the unpopular ones. A lot of people believe that pre-marital sex and cross dressing are immoral. That does not mean that we should start throwing people in prison who do those things.
1.1.3.5.;Con:;As the government is the only entity that can pass laws into legislation it can make every immoral act illegal. Whether an immoral act should be made illegal is supposed to be determined by society through the process of election, civil input, and academic discourse.
1.1.4.;Con:;There is no one objective ethical view, so no action - hate speech included, can be objectively ethically wrong.
1.1.4.1.;Con:;[Argumentation ethics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argumentation_ethics) proposed by Hans-Hermann Hoppe is, as claimed by its proposer, a proof that there is only one objective ethical point of view.
1.1.4.1.1.;Pro:;"Which is ""a dazzling breakthrough for political philosophy in general and for libertarianism in particular"" as Murray Rothbard said."
1.1.5.;Pro:;Hate speech should be discouraged around the world because of the emotional harm it does in the society amidst groups and humanity.
1.1.5.1.;Con:;Emotional harm is entirely dependent on interpretation, therefore allows abuse.
1.1.5.2.;Con:;Emotional harm caused by speech must be heard and allowed influence. While there are free speech laws, there is no rule to force anyone to pay attention to hate speech. Change in this causality chain should be in the choice to ignore, not prevent a right.
1.1.5.3.;Con:;Discouragement should not be done through law-enforcement.
1.1.5.3.1.;Pro:;"Social processes should indeed be guided by society not by lawmakers. Free speech is paramount from that perspective. There needs to be active discussion in the society and people should engage with each other \(as we are here\); hateful and even outright stupid thoughts need to be out in the open, so they could be criticized."
1.1.5.3.2.;Con:;Lawmaking needs to get involved, if voices of minorities get muffled or shouted down. Groups or individuals can't be forcibly left voiceless - this can \(and has\) lead to dehumanization and from there on out, violence is the next logical step.
1.1.5.3.2.1.;Con:;In practice it is the loud minorities that shout down the passive majority.
1.1.5.3.2.1.1.;Pro:;Black Lives matter, protesting against the existence of- and raising awareness of the [lowest relative murder](http://prntscr.com/kwn11k) rate if broken into racial group on racial group. Actuality: It being lowest, makes it least priority if one is to separate them in this fashion.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.;Pro:;Feminists claiming [rights inequality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_Rights_Amendment) still exist, based on perceived male-controlled society, when in actuality it is simply a matter of statistical distribution and unreasonably \(or as intellectual dishonesty\) interpreting statistical performance.
1.1.5.3.2.1.2.1.;Pro:;Women claiming there is a [Gender pay gap](https://i.imgur.com/YhfDNdX.png), while in actuality they are simply[falsely interpreting](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-gender-pay-gap-is-a-complete-myth/) a number of a statistic, without paying attention to what is behind it \(a combination of factors like regular work hours, work-family relative focus, productivity, biological reasons= varying effects across different professions\)
1.1.5.3.2.1.3.;Pro:;Vocal minorities pressure companies into enacting [gender quotas](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-42614795) and general diversity requirements that force employee selection [away from performance and niche skills](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paologaudiano/2018/04/02/stop-focusing-on-diversity/#190657ee6764). Said pressure is most often applied through [Heckler's veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler%27s_veto), as there is otherwise no other causality, nor legal requirement.
1.1.6.;Pro:;Making people feel unsafe or inferior is morally wrong.
1.1.6.1.;Con:;People can always feel unsafe or inferior even if that was not the intention of the one who said whatever it is that made them feel like that. And there is also no real measurable system for how unsafe you feel. That is why the law, until recently, was always concentrated on actual tangible facts, not feelings.
1.1.6.2.;Con:;It is not the fact that someone 'said something' that makes a person feel unsafe or inferior, it is only if they appear to be of great power/responsibility/popularity in the community that such emotions are elicited. Thus the problem is not the speech itself, but the authority of that speech that is offensive.
1.1.6.3.;Pro:;This is particularly true when such insults are based on an immutable characteristic.
1.1.6.3.1.;Pro:;Hate speech often takes the forms of racism, sexism or homophobia. Such insults are based respectively on the immutable characteristics of race, sex and sexuality.
1.1.6.4.;Con:;Putting criminals in prison makes them feel unsafe and inferior. This is not widely viewed as morally wrong.
1.1.6.4.1.;Con:;What is considered morally wrong for normal citizens is not always the same for the imprisoned, who have committed immoral acts themselves.
1.1.7.;Pro:;Hate speech communicates Hate Bias, which is a clearly defined crime. Social Policy determines that crime is never protected.[law.cornell.edu](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/249)
1.2.;Pro:;We ought to obey the U.S. Constitution's admonition against prohibiting free speech in the First Amendment.
1.2.1.;Pro:;The U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled that hate speech is legally protected speech.
1.2.1.1.;Pro:;For example, in Snyder v. Phelps, the Court ruled that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket a funeral‚Äîa deeply offensive act. [Six Supreme Court hate speech cases.](https://www.thoughtco.com/hate-speech-cases-721215)
1.2.1.2.;Con:;"The European Court of Human Rights has repeatedly ruled that  threatening to undermine state institutions by terror organizations is no free speech \([G√ºnd√ºz vs Turkey](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{""itemid"":\[""001-61522""\]})\)."
1.2.1.3.;Pro:;"The European Court of Human Rights ruled that incitement of ethnic hatred \([Balsytƒó-Lideikienƒó v. Lithuania](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{""itemid"":\[""002-1844""\]})\) is not a violation of the freedom of speech and therefore admissiable."
1.2.1.4.;Pro:;Especially online hate speech laws have been ruled to be more permissable.
1.2.1.4.1.;Pro:;"The four most recent cases of the European Court of Human Rights on this subject have all been deemed inadmissible or judged as no violation. \([Delfi AS v. Estonia](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng#{""itemid"":\[""003-5110487-6300958""\]}), [MTE v Hungary](http://Magyar Tartalomszolgaltatok Egyesulete and Index.hu Zrt v. Hungary), [Pihl v. Sweden](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{""itemid"":\[""003-5650866-7156310""\]}) & [Smajic v. Bosnia](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{""itemid"":\[""003-5999255-7685303""\]})\)"
1.2.1.5.;Con:;Displaying flags with controversial historical connotations was ruled by the ECHR to be not covered by free speech in [Faber v Hungary](https://hudoc.echr.coe.int/eng-press#{%22itemid%22:\[%22003-4029502-4701746%22\]}).
1.2.1.5.1.;Con:;"The linked source came to a conclusion opposite of what is claimed. Faber's display of the flag was protected by ""free expression."""
1.2.1.6.;Pro:;There is no need to privilege the protection of any kind of speech when, in the United States, there is no state action to censor such speech. Private entities can and should do with any speech what they will.
1.2.1.6.1.;Con:;This is only relevant to the USA, it does not apply to other countries which may have different laws.
1.2.2.;Con:;It's not the government's job to protect speech. It's the government's job not to infringe on speech.
1.2.2.1.;Con:;The government's job in this regard is not to manage just speech, but to ensure productive ideas and opinions and promote diverse thought and debate, while limiting harmful such, if harm would be sufficient. The exact need for limits is subjective and so varies across countries.
1.2.3.;Con:;Free speech limits human rights.
1.2.3.1.;Pro:;If all forms of free speech are accepted, we are legitimazing fascism, terrorism or xenophobic speech, which come from deep belief, not from reason, and thus cannot be beaten through discussion. So the forms of hate speech that attempt against human rights should be forbidden.
1.2.4.;Con:;Just because Americans have that constitutional right, it does not mean it should not be limited in certain cases.
1.2.4.1.;Con:;If the constitution is not considered legally binding, then it has no force.  It has been a force of good for over 200 years.
1.2.4.1.1.;Con:;Adding limitations, restrictions or amendments to the constitution doesn't invalidate its legal authority or power. If that was the case, the very amendment granting 'free speech' would have already invalidated it.
1.2.4.2.;Pro:;There are already limitations of the right to free speech such as intentionally inciting panic/terror, libel and fraud.
1.2.5.;Con:;Living in a society in which it is known one will eventually have to pay a small fine for calling someone a derogatory slur doesn't necessarily make you less free, it just makes the legal consequences of your speech more predictable.
1.2.6.;Con:;The constitution by it's nature is not necessarily the basis for a strong society, therefore as with all laws, they can be revisited based on what is best for society and the individuals within it.
1.2.7.;Pro:;"The [First Amendment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution) \(U.S. Constitution\) and [Article Nineteen](http://www.ohchr.org/EN/UDHR/Documents/UDHR_Translations/eng.pdf) \(United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights\) do not place conditions upon or permit any curtailment of speech; protection of speech should be applied as broadly as possible."
1.2.8.;Con:;That it is law is not really an argument for the question whether it should be law.
1.2.9.;Con:;Current limitations on speech are too weak. For example, under the [imminent lawless action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imminent_lawless_action) test, speech is not protected by the First Amendment only if the speaker intends to incite a violation of the law that is both imminent and likely.
1.2.10.;Con:;The US Constitution has no jurisdiction over hate speech in other countries.
1.2.10.1.;Con:;Other countries would do well to follow the US lead in this area and enact similar measures.
1.2.11.;Con:;Once speech becomes a tool that causes psychological harm to individuals it is no longer one of language but of abuse. See [Harvard University's research on verbal child abuse](https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/verbal-beatings-hurt-as-much-as-sexual-abuse/) which insists that \[speech\] is a form of abuse with lasting effects.
1.2.11.1.;Pro:;"Americans do have a right to freedom of speech, but when that speech causes intended visible harm to human beings; those individuals should be prosecuted. This does not mean people should not be able to say whatever they want, but simply that if they say something that hurts other humans beings, they must take responsibility for that."
1.2.11.1.1.;Con:;A risk of prosecution is a large gamble to take when it is not clear what speech is punishable, and what speech is not.
1.2.11.1.1.1.;Con:;If a person thinks that they are taking a risk in saying something, that means they understand that what they are saying could be potentially harmful. We risk getting in car accidents by being around vehicles. speech is different in that it is much more subjective than traffic laws, but people still get into accidents, and make mistakes when they speak. The laws surrounding hate speech are not as extensive as traffic laws, and perhaps they should be, in a complex, hierarchical structure.
1.2.11.2.;Con:;"Since there is no widely-accepted definition of ""hate speech,"" this gives far too much leeway for the law to be selectively enforced according to people and speech that authorities just happen to dislike."
1.2.11.2.1.;Pro:;"""Hate speech"" is subjective, since some people will take offense to something when others will not.  ""To think is to risk offending"".  The only exception to this would be a direct incitement to be violent."
1.2.11.2.1.1.;Con:;One could argue that hate speech increases the probability of violence.
1.2.11.2.1.2.;Pro:;The difficulty with legislating any form of speech lies in drawing the line between what is acceptable and what isn't. However, the value in avoiding the significant mental and societal harm caused by hate speech outweighs any negative consequences associated with drawing a difficult line.
1.2.11.2.1.3.;Pro:;"The very definition of [what constitutes hate speech is subjective.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2014/02/04/a-new-argument-for-hate-speech-laws-um-no/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.97701f5b747c)  Consequentially, legislative restrictions on what constitutes ""hate speech"" will be decided by the majority at the expense of what the minority believes to be their free speech rights."
1.2.11.2.1.4.;Pro:;"Perception of ""hate"" in other people""s speech lies with the observer, not necessarily with the speaker. This gives way to subjectivism, and ever increasing censorship."
1.2.11.2.1.5.;Pro:;The term 'hate speech' itself is nothing more than a disingenuous rhetorical device used to stifle the free exchange of ideas. The evidence lies in the adjective itself, which must be defended against before any controversy on the original subject can even be addressed.
1.2.11.2.1.6.;Con:;A version of the [Miller Test](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/obscenity) could be used to determine whether or not speech constitutes hate speech.
1.2.11.2.1.6.1.;Con:;"The Miller Test which is used to determine 'obscenity' is again quite subjective, as the linked article does state that the Supreme Court has repeatedly struggled with what it defines as ""problematic elements"".  This is also confounded by the fact that different states have their own individual laws regarding this."
1.2.11.2.1.7.;Con:;There are some rules that define hate speech. For example it is legitimate to use stronger words against politicians than regular citizens as ruled by the ECHR in the [Oberschlick case](http://lehofer.at/blog/Oberschlick_2.pdf).
1.2.11.2.1.7.1.;Con:;Which is yet another example of discriminatory rules. It is impossible to justify a difference in accepted behavior towards a politician and a convicted criminal for example \(which is a regular citizen\).
1.2.11.2.2.;Con:;"Cases of hate speech are not defined until proven that they have caused harm to individual\(s\). This is how [common law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_law) works, and should be applied to hate speech. Laws should not be made preventing people from saying specific things, but judges and juries should decide if that action was abusive or not, and act accordingly, after the ""crime"" was committed. We are all innocent until proven guilty."
1.2.11.2.3.;Pro:;Hate is an emotion.  If you prohibit some speech, based on the emotion and or thoughts of the one who spoke it, then you are suggesting that some thoughts or emotions should be illegal as well.  This is a slippery slope best avoided by simply protecting all speech.
1.2.11.2.4.;Pro:;Any speech may be deemed hateful by someone who disagrees with it.
1.2.11.2.4.1.;Con:;"Opinion does not equate to legislation. The process for developing and signing into law restrictions is much more complex and requires more support than a single ""anyone's"" opinion."
1.2.11.2.5.;Con:;-> See 1.2.11.2.1.6.
1.2.11.2.6.;Pro:;This ['selective censorship](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-hate-speech-censorship-internal-documents-algorithms)' is already in affect on Facebook. Its algorithms protect the speech of white men while censoring those of Black people.
1.2.11.2.6.1.;Con:;There is no racial bias as implied by the somewhat incendiary headline. 'White men' are a protected category, as are 'Black men', because race and gender are protected. 'Black children' are not protected, because age is not a protected category, but nor are 'White children'. 'Black people' would also constitute a protected category. 'White male republicans' would not.
1.2.11.2.6.2.;Con:;"It is not ""inconsistent"", as the source says, for Facebook to censor a post condemning all white people as racists, but not to censor a post specifically targeting radicalised Muslims who are murdering people. That is nothing to do with protecting the speech of white men or censoring black people."
1.2.11.2.7.;Con:;"A minimal set of hate speech could easily be defined which is universally acceptable.  Even if it is as narrow as ""any speech which tells others to kill all members of a set race"". The line where hate speech ends may be impossible to define, but some speech can still safely be defined hate speech."
1.2.11.2.7.1.;Con:;Codified limitation on allowed/not allowed speech means constant update based on location, time, initiator, target, and indicate levels of hatred regarding all these criteria which in practice is impossible to manage.
1.2.11.2.8.;Con:;The [common definition](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hate_speech) of hate speech is speech that is abusive or threatening, or writing that expresses prejudice against a particular group based on race, gender, or sexual orientation.
1.2.11.2.8.1.;Con:;"That is from the [Top english dictionary](https://www.quora.com/Which-is-the-best-English-dictionary).  The other highly rated dictionaries vary slightly in actions listed:[""expresses hate or encourages violence...""](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hate-speech) , [""disparaging...""](https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/hate-speech), and [""attacks, threatens, or insults...""](http://www.dictionary.com/browse/hate-speech?s=t)."
1.2.11.2.8.2.;Con:;Most dictionaries, including the [definition talked about here](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/hate_speech), list the groups \[race, religion, gender\] [as examples](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hate-speech), and do not presume to define a standard list of groups, or even wether [individuals](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/hate-speech) can be considered a target.
1.2.11.2.8.3.;Con:;"The terms ""abusive"" and ""threatening"" are by no means objective or even consistently defined. [Oxford Dictionaries](http://oxforddictionaries.com)"
1.2.11.2.8.3.1.;Pro:;"For example, ""threatening"" may mean simply having a ""hostile quality"" or, in law, ""showing an intention to cause bodily harm."" ""Abusive"" may be ""extremely offensive and insulting"" or ""engaging in or characterized by habitual violence and cruelty."" Thus ""hate speech"" could be considered either constituting psychic harm or physical harm, which must be distinguished from one another."
1.2.11.2.9.;Pro:;"""Hate speech"" should be protected because the definition of ""hate"" is broad, not objective, and often, practically, includes factual statements to which some may take offense \(see [""American Renaissance Banned from Twitter""](https://www.amren.com/news/2017/12/press-release-jared-taylor-american-renaissance-banned-twitter/)\). Because of their non-objective nature, offenses may be used by those in power to restrict criticism."
1.2.11.2.9.1.;Con:;We can only protect legally that which is defined clearly. Hate speech is difficult, at best, to define. Both in where it ends and where it begins.
1.2.11.2.9.1.1.;Con:;This is not how constitutional laws work. Freedom of speech is a negative right.[Negative and positive rights](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_and_positive_rights)
1.2.11.2.10.;Pro:;Hate speech laws are really about giving certain groups licence to degrade certain other groups. The laws are discriminatory and should not exist.
1.2.11.2.11.;Pro:;Unpopular speech is the speech most in need of free speech protections since no one objects to popular speech.
1.2.12.;Pro:;Part of free speech is the right to offend.
1.2.12.1.;Pro:;Our rights are sacred. Our feelings are not. Once you have given away your rights, the government will not voluntarily give them back.
1.2.12.1.1.;Pro:;The Patriot Act still exists, even though the Government told Americans that it was a temporary measure to fight terrorists in 2001.
1.2.12.1.2.;Pro:;When the political climate changes out of your favor in the future, your opponents will have the ability to silence your speech as well.
1.2.12.1.2.1.;Con:;This assumes that the restrictions on hate speech are exceedingly general and fluid. A properly defined set of regulations may still be mutable in future settings, but not merely by political whim.
1.2.12.1.3.;Con:;The right to incite psychological harm and fear in innocent people is not a right anyone should have.
1.2.12.1.3.1.;Con:;If the creating fear in innocent people is not a right anyone should have, why should the government create such fear by repressing any speech? Such repression would lead to the very fear it intends to prevent.
1.2.12.1.3.1.1.;Con:;In this case the speaker isn't 'innocent.' Furthermore the government in most 'free societies' does not enforce law through inciting terror or fear, but through a judicial process with appeals and checks.
1.2.12.1.4.;Con:;Most rights held by people today were rarely 'given' to them, more often those rights had to be fought for and earned. If the 'right to hate' is take or given away, it is not necessarily one that should be given back.
1.2.12.1.4.1.;Con:;People have as much the right to their emotions as their bodies. The government should not be trying to regulate any emotion, even hate.
1.2.12.1.4.1.1.;Con:;Regulating hate speech isn't regulating emotion, but action. It is not illegal to be so mad with someone that you want them dead. It is illegal to take the actions that lead to their death.
1.2.12.1.4.1.1.1.;Pro:;This is the reason that minors are generally tried under a different set of laws and are not legally responsible for themselves. ie why a child's parents make medical decisions for their children.
1.2.12.2.;Pro:;"""Hate Speech"" is a made up pejorative, used by post-modernists in order to silence those will different opinions and beliefs. Short of inciting panic and direct calls for violence, all speech must be free, or we are not free people. [www.youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbsZAyKFh2g)"
1.2.12.2.1.;Con:;It is true that the notion of ''hateful speech'' can and is sometimes used abusively to disparage an opinion one disagrees with.  The temptation to recourse to such a sophism toward non hateful speech  is not a sufficient ground to allow the expression of hateful speech.
1.2.12.3.;Pro:;If free speech is intended for anyone, it is for the most unsavory and unpopular opinions in existence. It is not necessary to protect already accepted ideas and modes of communication.
1.2.12.3.1.;Con:;Hate speech is not simply unsavory or unpalatable, it is an attempt to remove human rights from certain groups of people due to characteristics that are beyond their control, such as race, gender, sexuality, or nation of origin. If we hold as self-evident the belief that all humans are created equal, then speech that seeks to define other humans as non-equals should be regulated.
1.2.12.4.;Con:;"One can offend without using hate speech. saying ""You're hair is ugly, and your style is tacky"" is offensive without being hate speech."
1.2.12.4.1.;Con:;Far too often any comment about looks and style \(as given in the parent\) are seen as attacks on the racial characteristics or culture of the attacked. This could classify this speach as hate speech.
1.2.12.4.1.1.;Pro:;Often such comments are a result of racial biases or result in racial biases, this is not intrinsically the case.
1.2.12.5.;Con:;Offensive and hateful are not synonymous.
1.2.12.6.;Con:;Hate speech encourages hateful and harmful action, which is an impediment to the freedom of others.
1.2.12.6.1.;Pro:;Hate-Speech used as a political instrument might shape the public view on a minority and make them more vulnerable to attacks.
1.2.12.6.1.1.;Con:;The general public's views on various demographics should be accountable to the general public.
1.2.12.6.1.2.;Pro:;Hate speech is a politically motivated construct that targets non-protected groups while favoring protected groups.
1.2.12.6.1.2.1.;Pro:;-> See 1.1.3.1.
1.2.12.6.1.2.2.;Con:;Protecting certain groups more than others can be justified in order to enable the freedom of the protected group.
1.2.12.6.1.2.2.1.;Con:;Protecting certain groups more than others is a sure means to make the 'certain' groups have the sense that others in the society believe them unable to stand on their own feet, and in some instances to believe it themselves.
1.2.12.6.1.2.2.2.;Con:;Even if certain groups should be afforded rights not enjoyed by others, it's not clear how we'd identify those groups, or judge how much protection they need, or how we'd evaluate whether the banning of 'hate speech' was helping those groups more than harming them.
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.;Pro:;No rigorous, objective test of hate speech exists. It is a charge selectively levelled only at politically weak out-groups.
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.1.;Con:;"Considering context, the term ""straight white male"" and similar versions fall under hate speech too. Straight white males are not a politically weak out-group, but a non-reactionary one for the most part."
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.1.1.;Pro:;That term attempts to [diminish someone's opinion and status](https://twitter.com/joshdenny/status/997604506522140672?lang=en).
1.2.12.6.1.2.3.1.2.;Pro:;It is [censored in BF5](https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/9e2n9t/battlefield_v_censors_white_man_in_the_chat/), which is notorious for its SJW theme.
1.2.12.6.1.3.;Con:;If hate speech is being used as a political tool by government, then legislating against it, will only give that government more authority to continue their propaganda, as they will have the power to say anything that disagrees with their propaganda is hate speech.
1.2.12.6.1.4.;Pro:;Hate speech is powerful and can lead to emulation, especially in societies which are experiencing economic difficulties.
1.2.12.6.1.5.;Pro:;"Hate speech can be used by populist politicians to whip up the support by finding an ""enemy"" in a minority group."
1.2.12.6.2.;Pro:;Hate speech inculcates beliefs into vulnerable people and makes them more susceptible to being influenced to performing acts of discrimination, violence, and eventually killing those in the target field.
1.2.12.6.2.1.;Con:;All speech tries to communicate ideas to others. It does not follow that ideas communicated must be inculcated into beliefs by the recipient.
1.2.12.6.2.2.;Con:;Hate speech and incitement to commit a crime are separate ideas. Many things, for example, alcohol, create situations where vulnerable people are more susceptible to being incited to commit a crime also.
1.2.12.6.2.3.;Pro:;Those who are in the targeted field of the hate speech are at risk of this violence in all aspects of their lives, at work, at play, at their houses of worship, and even in their own homes.
1.2.12.6.2.4.;Pro:;Hate speech indoctrinates the vulnerable into adopting extremist views. It leads to wide spread radicalisation which is detrimental to society.
1.2.12.6.3.;Pro:;Hate speech is equivalent to an act of violence because of the pain it willingly inflicts on others. Hence it must be controlled.
1.2.12.6.3.1.;Con:;While violence may be an impediment to other's freedom, hate speech in itself is not.
1.2.12.6.3.1.1.;Con:;Hate speech is usually the breeding ground for violence against certain groups.
1.2.12.6.3.1.2.;Pro:;People have legal responsibility for themselves. The consequences of your actions are your own.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.;Con:;Hate speech is likely to intimidate the people it is directed at, discouraging these individuals' participation in public debates and freedom of expression.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.1.;Con:;Freedom of speech is not the freedom to engage in hate speech which leads to hate crime, freedom to express hate is not in the constitution.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.1.1.;Con:;Hate speech does not violate anyone's rights, nor does it guarantee violence. The resulting crime, provoked or not, is responsibility of the acting party and nobody else.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.2.;Con:;The Civil Rights Movement was not discouraged by hate speech.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.2.1.;Con:;One historical example alone is not a good by itself, and while it was not dissuaded, many paid the ultimate price. Had hate speech been banned, the outcome might have been different.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.2.2.;Con:;They were not dissuaded, but to argue that the actors in the civil rights movements weren't fearful of or discouraged by the hate speech and the hateful repercussions they faced is wrong.
1.2.12.6.3.1.3.3.;Con:;This is a matter for society not the legislature. Freedoms are encouraged when less control is ceded to the state.
1.2.12.6.3.1.4.;Con:;Inflicting intentional psychological trauma is a form of violence. Causing someone to regularly fear for their safety quickly degrades their quality of life. These are the same reasons stalking and death threats are not ignored in the name of freedom or free speech.
1.2.12.6.4.;Con:;Encouraging harmful behaviour is already illegal and is only a subset of what most people define as hate speech.
1.2.12.6.4.1.;Con:;Using a platform to promote damaging stereotypes can ultimately result in the dehumanisation of the groups they portray, legitimising their mistreatment or violence against them. This is not illegal in the U.S.
1.2.12.6.4.2.;Con:;"Specificity is required in legislation; take for instance the issues surrounding ['up-skirting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upskirt)' which is a violation of people's privacy but occurs in public spaces and has therefor had rulings go both was as to it's legality."
1.2.12.6.4.3.;Con:;It is not true that inciting violence is only part of what people consider hate speech. In Canada where hate speech is outlawed, for example, [it is defined in section 318 and 319 of the Criminal Code](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-46/page-73.html#h-93) as advocating genocide, or encouraging hatred towards a group which is likely to lead to a breach of the peace.
1.2.12.6.4.4.;Pro:;International Law already prohibits incitement. This includes advocacy of national, racial or religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence. [International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights](https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx) \(ICCPR\) - signed by 172 countries.
1.2.12.6.4.4.1.;Con:;Nation states observe the principle of 'Par in parem non habet imperium', \(Between equals there is no sovereign power\) John Austin therefore asserted that 'so-called' international law, lacking a sovereign power and so unenforceable, was not really law at all, but 'positive morality', consisting of 'opinions and sentiments...more ethical than legal in nature.[papers.ssrn.com](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2213675) This study has shown that 1 in 7 countries are willing to violate international law.
1.2.12.6.4.4.2.;Con:;Such a law is incompatible with the premise of the debate - that 'hate speech' be legally protected - so it should not be used as an argument in favour of hate speech being legally protected as it would be overturned.
1.2.12.6.5.;Con:;-> See 1.2.12.6.3.1.
1.2.12.6.6.;Con:;"Many instances of supposed ""hate speech"" pose no discernible physical threat. \(See numerous examples [here](https://www.thefire.org/category/cases/free-speech/).\)"
1.2.12.6.6.1.;Con:;And yet many of them do. It is difficult to argue, for instance, that the [31% of hate crimes in the united states driven by a bias motivation against black people](https://edition.cnn.com/2017/06/02/us/who-commits-hate-crimes/index.html)are completely unmotivated by their shocking portrayal in The West for hundreds of years.
1.2.12.6.6.2.;Con:;Psychological harm is just as valid as physical harm, such as PTSD.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.;Con:;The idea that psychological harm is just as valid as physical harm, if legally confirmed, would allow for lethal repercussions to perceived insults as self-defense.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.;Con:;No, Self defense has a principle of justifiable harm. You can't murder someone because they are going to punch you, you can however strike them to protect yourself. Self defense when it comes to insults would equate to being allowed to insult your insult-er back - which is generally the social paradigm as it stands now.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.1.;Con:;Murder is not self-defense.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.2.;Con:;Lethal force is authorized in self-defense situations. That is why they are called self-defense situations, because life and liberty are being attacked.
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.1.2.1.;Con:;"Only when there is a reasonable inference of intent to kill. One can not kill someone just because they are about to slap them; that would be murder."
1.2.12.6.6.2.1.2.;Con:;There are several psychological conditions which can result from non-physical trauma which can result in the sufferer physically harming themselves. Such as, but not limited to cases of self-harm and attempts at suicide as the result of bullying amongst teens and young adults.
1.2.12.6.7.;Pro:;Hate speech that calls for violence, or evokes symbolism or imagery of groups that have a history of perpetuating violence should be curtailed.
1.2.12.6.7.1.;Con:;Laws are already in place in most states of America \(and most countries around the world\) to deal with threats of violence. It is called [ethnic intimidation](https://definitions.uslegal.com/e/ethnic-intimidation/) , [forceful intimidation](https://definitions.uslegal.com/f/forceful-intimidation-because-of-race/) or something similar depending on the specific threat of violence \(religious, ethnic or otherwise\).
1.2.12.6.8.;Con:;Speech does not have to be hateful to encourage violent action.
1.2.12.6.9.;Con:;"""Hate speech"" results in no physical harms; one may argue there are psychic harms, though this is dependent on individual predispositions and interpretations, which cannot be codified into law."
1.2.12.6.9.1.;Con:;Psychic harms get codified into law all the time. For example, it is illegal to walk around a city naked. There is no other possible explanation for banning walking around naked than the psychic harm it causes on others. Therefore, it is obviously possible to codify psychic harms into law.
1.2.12.6.9.1.1.;Con:;"There is a much larger grey area with hate speech than public nudity. Public nudity is discrete; either you are naked, or you are not. If you are naked we have agreed that this is unacceptable due to psychic harm to others. Hate speech is more complicated as it is hard to determine when freedom of expression crosses a line into hate speech."
1.2.12.6.9.1.1.1.;Con:;Nudity is not quite that discrete. Clothing that is too skimpy or too revealing is commonly equated with nudity. The line between nudity and non-nudity is a matter of cultural norms, which vary over time and are always subject to contestation.
1.2.12.6.9.2.;Con:;Hate speech results in physical harm if it persuades people to take violent action.
1.2.12.6.9.2.1.;Con:;Hate speech is not a significant causality to violent action. The latter requires significant, but not sufficient intent in order for hate speech to be the deterministic influence.
1.2.12.6.9.2.1.1.;Pro:;In a similar sense, mood can be deterministic for whether to commit a crime or not. Mood is not regulated by law, however. Despite being able to have different effects, depending on context and situation, the same can be said for hate speech.
1.2.12.6.10.;Pro:;"Hate speech creates an ""othering"" mentality which normalizes hateful behavior towards its targets by dehumanizing them. It is detrimental to the goal of a peaceful and collaborative society between humans."
1.2.12.6.10.1.;Con:;"It could be argued that an ""othering"" mentality already exists, and that hate speech is an expression of this mentality."
1.2.12.6.11.;Con:;Labeling something someone says as 'hate speech' is essentially an attack on their character, not an argument as to why what they said is objectionable.
1.2.12.6.12.;Con:;Listening to provocative and disturbing speech allows one to reflect on and consider ideas they find objectionable. Such open-mindedness improves learning.
1.2.12.6.12.1.;Pro:;Being able to hear different perspective can provide valuable lessons about where society still needs to grow as a whole.
1.2.12.6.13.;Pro:;It leads to further harmful consequences that might even involve crimes.
1.2.12.6.13.1.;Con:;Crimes, by their definition, are already illegal.
1.2.12.6.13.2.;Con:;Speech that is hateful and speech that incites violence are inherently different and should be treated as such in legislation.   If not, we allow those inciting violence, under speech that isn't considered hateful under whatever legal framework were to exist, to act violently in the same manner as this argument portrays.
1.2.12.6.13.3.;Con:;There are a lot of things that lead to harmful consequences that might even involve crimes. As a justification to ban speech, this is overtly dangerous.
1.2.12.6.13.4.;Pro:;Hate speech can cause in the recipient of the message direct, adverse physical and emotional changes. The repeated use of such expressions cause and reinforce the subordination of these minorities.
1.2.12.6.14.;Con:;This is not a guaranteed action. This dismisses the idea that others can think for themselves. Hate speech does not guarantee hateful action, and saying otherwise disrespects the base value.
1.2.12.6.15.;Pro:;Hate speech often gets easily, quickly wide spread by tabloids and general media, and thus learnt and replicated. [Neo-nazi rally in the news](https://www.haaretz.com/world-news/europe/hundreds-of-neo-nazis-march-in-berlin-on-anniversary-of-hess-death-1.6388393)
1.2.12.6.15.1.;Pro:;Sometimes even unwillingly creating heroes, icons and role-models for those hate groups. [Praise to a Neo-nazi murderer](http://leejohnbarnes.blogspot.com/2009/09/freedom-for-josue-estebanez-de-la-hija.html)
1.2.12.6.15.2.;Pro:;We learn by imitation. That's why suicide usually doesn't get any media coverage. [social learning by imitation](http://web.colby.edu/socialpsychology/2015/03/21/social-learning-learning-through-imitation/)
1.2.12.6.16.;Con:;"Any speech which encourages harmful action is already illegal and therefore, no new law should be created to designate ""hate speech"" as something different."
1.2.13.;Pro:;To announce something as hate speech, one is the judge, jury and executioner of what is acceptable and legitimate.  Anything but absolute free speech is someone else in control of speech.
1.2.14.;Pro:;"The Constitutions 'Bill of Rights'; were written with the belief that these rights were 'Self-evident' and, as such, these rights are 'inalienable'. It was never the Constitution granting these rights; it was only recognizing these 'Truths' exist. If an individual is seeking to remove one of these Rights it is the governments duty to protect these Rights."
1.2.15.;Pro:;Hate speech being protected serves as a reminder of how it applies to everyone, not just people you agree with.
1.2.16.;Con:;Just because something is currently codified into law, such as the amendments to the U.S. Constitution, does not make them moral sound 'ad infinitum.' The ability to question and change laws that are dysfunctional or insufficient leads to a stronger legal system and society.
1.3.;Pro:;Only unpopular/disagreeable speech needs legal protection, as it's disagreeable unpopularity threatens it by default.
1.3.1.;Con:;Hate speech is not unpopular or offensive. It usually contains a verbal threat, and as such it should not be permitted. In addition, hate speech is usually used by those with power against those who are weak
1.3.2.;Con:;If certain speech acts seek to discourage the equal distribution of liberty among all people \(such as revoking it from a minority group\), it would be absurd to argue that this is somehow in service of liberty.
1.4.;Pro:;There's no dichotomy between harmless speech and harmful speech, because all speech has consequences.
1.5.;Con:;Consequentialist arguments support the regulation of hate speech.
1.6.;Con:;Hate speech is too subjective to be defined, and thus protected.
1.6.1.;Pro:;-> See 1.2.11.2.9.1.
1.6.2.;Con:;-> See 1.2.11.2.1.7.
1.6.3.;Con:;-> See 1.2.11.2.7.
1.6.4.;Con:;-> See 1.2.11.2.8.
1.6.5.;Pro:;-> See 1.2.11.2.1.3.
1.6.6.;Pro:;-> See 1.2.11.2.
1.6.7.;Con:;-> See 1.2.11.2.9.
1.6.8.;Con:;Any society that holds a blanket protection of speech implicitly holds a protection of hate speech. A definition of hate speech isn't needed to protect hate speech. A definition is actually needed to specifically *not* protect it
1.6.9.;Con:;This is not logical: if hate speech is too subjective to be protected then it will be too subjective to be interdicted.
1.6.10.;Con:;If we protect any speech that does not instigate to commit crimes against a person or a group of people, we can have both our freedom and safety.
1.6.11.;Con:;The statement is ignorant of the law. For example, Hate has been objectively codified into California statutes sections 422.55, 422.6, 422.7, and 422.75 PC against Hate Bias. Hate Bias is precisely what is being communicated with hate speech.
1.6.12.;Con:;There is no such thing as hate speech, as an objective classification- only speech, which should be protected- period.
1.6.12.1.;Con:;"Law deals with plenty of ambiguities. Threats, extortion, slander, and blackmail are all often delivered as speech acts -- these categories do not exist as ""objective"" classifications either."
1.6.13.;Con:;All speech is constitutionally protected \(in countries with freedom of speech\), with exclusions explicitly stated. All that is necessary to protect hate speech is to not explicitly state that it is excluded from the blanket protection on speech.
1.6.14.;Pro:;"Not all speech is protected, so hate speech could become illegal if we could define it in the most concise manner. If the use of the ""N"" word is considered provocative and brings about violent reactions then certain words could be considered illegal to use."
1.6.14.1.;Con:;The [Heckler's veto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heckler%27s_veto) should not be an argument and ought to not be allowed to dictate outcome of anything. The reaction to a word is responsibility of the reacting party, not the speaking one. Incitement to violence is an exception, that could still be debated.
1.7.;Con:;Hate speech has no benefit to society whatsoever and can therefore be banned without harm.
1.7.1.;Con:;Hate speech legislation consistently applied would prevent expressions of severe contempt for things that are worthy it, thus harming society.
1.7.2.;Con:;Hate speech can bring awareness to underlying issues in society that may otherwise be hidden if it was not protected.
1.7.2.1.;Con:;There are different ways to unearth underlying issues/problems: people can express their opinions in a respectful manner.
1.7.2.1.1.;Con:;What is and what is not respectful is deeply subjective. In the end, packaging your perspective a certain way does not always prevent someone from being offended if that person takes offense at the different perspective itself.
1.7.2.1.2.;Con:;People can, but most often do not, especially when they are emotionally triggered, which is when their expression is often the most raw and authentic
1.7.3.;Pro:;Hate speech in an educated society harms the speaker more than his/her intended victims. The key to fighting hate speech is not in regulating it but in educating the society how to deal with it and other forms of communication abuse \(i.e. cyber-bullying\).
1.7.3.1.;Con:;It only 'harms the speaker more' because of the social/civil repercussions they face due to it not being legally protected.  Where as in all contexts, hate speech harms the victim.
1.7.4.;Con:;All speech should be protected by default, due to the complexity and controversy of selecting an authority to determine what constitutes forbidden hate speech.
1.7.4.1.;Pro:;All speech on any topic has at least weak and indirect effects on policy that can add up to a matter of life or death for someone.
1.7.4.2.;Con:;Just because policy determination is complex does not mean that it should be avoided or that policy modification, retraction, or expansion should not occur. \([Negativity bias](https://yourbias.is/)\)
1.7.4.3.;Con:;The Southern Poverty Law Center is an [arguably well respected](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/26/after-conservative-backlash-charity-tracker-guidestar-removes-hate-group-labels/?utm_term=.11576296e05a) [authority](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Southern-Poverty-Law-Center) in this field already.
1.7.4.3.1.;Con:;"The Southern Poverty Law Center has itself created [controversy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Poverty_Law_Center#Controversies_over_hate_group_and_extremist_listings) and [psychological harm](https://www.voiceofthevoiceless.info/i-was-traumatized-by-the-southern-poverty-law-centers-hate-campaign-against-ex-gays) by labeling those they disagree with \(including mainstream figures and organizations such as Ben Carson and the Family Research Council\) as ""extremists,"" even though these so-called ""extremists"" do not advocate for persecution or harassment of those with whom they disagree."
1.7.4.3.1.1.;Con:;There is value in being able to make mistakes. No governing body, or individual is without their share of mistakes and repercussions. That is the reason why our legal systems have redundancies and methods of appeal.
1.7.4.3.2.;Con:;The splc is [currently facing litigation](http://www1.cbn.com/cbnnews/us/2018/april/southern-poverty-law-center-deletes-list-of-anti-muslim-extremists-after-legal-threat) for defamation after listing Maajid Nawaz as an anti-Muslim extremest. Maajid Nawaz is a liberal Muslim who founded an anti-extremist think tank in the UK.
1.7.4.3.3.;Pro:;There are also areas of academia which focus on studying these issues and their effects on actors which would allow various governing bodies to make informed decisions on regulation.
1.7.4.4.;Pro:;No authority established by a majority could be guaranteed to protect the free speech rights of the minority.
1.7.4.4.1.;Con:;Uncurtailed free speech can incite hatred, mistreatment and even violence, especially against minority groups. It is more practical to curtail such speech in the first place.
1.7.4.4.1.1.;Con:;-> See 1.2.12.6.4.4.
1.7.4.4.1.2.;Pro:;People should have the right to spaces where hate speech against them is not allowed. For example the family of a deceased black person should have the right to have a funeral without being harassed by the KKK.
1.7.4.5.;Pro:;"Any speech that challenges the views of the majority \(or those in power\) could be classified as ""hateful."""
1.7.4.5.1.;Pro:;"Recent [court cases cited by Amnesty International](https://elpais.com/elpais/2018/02/22/inenglish/1519292044_500937.html) \(and [others](https://www.opendemocracy.net/can-europe-make-it/pablo-casta-o/free-speech-under-siege-in-spain)\) arguably show freedom of speech being arbitrarily restricted in Spain on the grounds of being too extreme or ""[disrespectful](http://theconversation.com/spains-freedom-of-speech-repression-is-no-joke-75889),"" especially in cases that are [critical of the government](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/world/europe/echr-spain-free-speech.html)."
1.7.4.5.2.;Pro:;If hate speech is illegal, hateful things will seem more hateful than they already were, giving them power.
1.7.4.6.;Pro:;All speech is provocative.  An important part of the human experience is to confront, debate, discuss, and provide different perspectives. Without this, we are controlled, ruled, oppressed and dehumanised.
1.7.4.6.1.;Pro:;One of the most significant differences between humans and AI is in the ability of the former to consider context and weight up different perspectives. Bad interpretation is a result of lack of exposure to different contexts and little consideration.
1.7.4.7.;Con:;-> See 1.2.12.6.7.
1.7.5.;Con:;Hate speech reveals the biases of the speaker, providing critical information to potential employers, voters etc.
1.7.6.;Pro:;"Adding the qualifier of ""hate"" makes it not speech. It makes it something used to negatively impact a person's thoughts or well being--either by enforcing a false narrative or depriving someone else of their right to life, liberty and pursuit of happiness, by using false and slanderous words to denigrate a person based on their uncontrollable status."
1.7.6.1.;Con:;"There is no universally-recognized definition of ""hate speech,"" so the qualifier of ""hate"" can't imply anything more than that one person or group finds it objectionable. [Source](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/volokh-conspiracy/wp/2015/05/07/no-theres-no-hate-speech-exception-to-the-first-amendment/?utm_term=.b874b4085be1)"
1.8.;Con:;According to the paradox of tolerance, enabling certain liberties may have an overall negative impact over freedom.
1.8.1.;Con:;"The ""paradox of tolerance"" is viewpoint dependent. Hate speech laws are currently being used to silence dissent -- silence the very people pointing out the intolerance that we should be intolerant of."
1.8.2.;Pro:;Intolerant rhetoric often calls for explicitly or at least suggests the curtailing of liberties for certain other groups. Protecting hate speech places a society under the constant threat of having the liberties it prizes be undone.
1.8.3.;Con:;Man can not enable liberties, only disable liberties. Disabling liberties is done for the sake of 'safety/surety' - not for the sake of freedom.
1.8.3.1.;Con:;Disabling the liberty to limit other people liberties is beneficial for freedom.
1.8.4.;Con:;The solution to the paradox of tolerance is to speak out against the intolerance rather than legislate against them.
1.8.4.1.;Con:;The lie flies faster and farther than the rebuttal. If hate speech has incited deaths of some before the reasonable minded argument against it has entered the debate, you provided no solution to the paradox of tolerance.
1.8.5.;Pro:;Unlimited tolerance can lead to the extinction of tolerance. Defending tolerance requires to not tolerate the intolerant.
1.8.5.1.;Pro:;Ethically, you need only tolerate the tolerant. Since hate speech is focused on attributes one is born with and thus not changeable, hate speech is by definition intolerant.
1.8.6.;Con:;The paradox of tolerance is not consistent, internally or externally, and applies to itself, thus negating it's impact entirely. We cannot tolerate the intolerant, has no meaning because it means you cannot tolerate the lack of tolerating the intolerant either. Since it cancels out it's own argument, it therefore is not a valid philosophy, or reasonable position.
1.8.7.;Pro:;Allowing all forms of speech, including hateful and violent speech will eventually lead to the immunity developing in our species to feeling affected by insult/hate speech, removing the bigger downsides to hate speech and allowing people to use hate speech to blow off steam reducing stress.
1.8.8.;Pro:;-> See 1.2.12.6.
1.8.9.;Con:;"Karl Popper took the opposite stance when he came up with the idea of the Paradox of Tolerance in his book The Open Society And Its Enemies: ""In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies ; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise."" - pg 226"
1.8.9.1.;Con:;Hate speech is seldom, if ever, rational. The notion that violence -- including violent language -- can be overcome with sheer rationality seems misguided. You cannot parry a fist with rhetoric.
1.9.;Pro:;Real, absolute freedom means the freedom to say anything you like, including hateful things.
1.9.1.;Con:;Being able to say things that incur violence inhibit other people's rights and freedom.
1.9.2.;Con:;This begs the question by assuming that absolute freedom of speech is desirable. It is not.
1.9.2.1.;Pro:;Allowing hate speech can cause psychological harm to those its directed towards.
1.9.2.1.1.;Con:;-> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.1.
1.9.2.1.2.;Con:;-> See 1.1.3.2.1.1.2.
1.9.2.1.3.;Con:;Not knowing what others think of you, because those others are afraid of a state with a monopoly on force -- even what they think of you for unjustified reasons -- leads to worry and neurosis over what others think of oneself.
1.9.3.;Con:;We all are absolutely free to say and do what we like, but those things all come with both positive and negative consequences. Hate speech should be allowed until it becomes something more than speech itself.
1.9.3.1.;Con:;"Speech is always more than 'speech itself' we have and cherish speech in its forms because of its ability to affect change in our fellows. Its the reason we read, write, and tell stories; watch movies; code games; etc."
1.9.4.;Con:;Free speech is already protected in most countries, but there is a very real and significant difference between free speech and hate speech. When free speech crosses the line into advocating harm \(even implicitly\) to others, usually vulnerable minorities, that legal protection quite rightly falls away.
1.9.4.1.;Con:;"The problem with more and more of the ""hate speech laws"" is that they do not fight the speech that incites to harm, but instead they police the way people can speak. As it is with the now famous bill C-16 from Canada. [Bill c16 text](http://www.parl.ca/DocumentViewer/en/42-1/bill/C-16/first-reading)"
1.9.4.2.;Pro:;Pro abortion arguments are hate speech because they advocate harm to people based on their age. Advocating the division and dismantling of Israel is hate speech because it is anti-semitic. Threatening to single out churches for taxation is hate speech because it advocates harm to people based on their beliefs. Saying it is ok to punch a Nazi is hate speech.
1.9.5.;Con:;If hate speech should be legally protected, then so should murder, rape, robbery, cannibalism and other types of crime committed in the name of freedom. Freedom cannot be absolute lest it becomes total anarchism.
1.9.5.1.;Con:;"Hate speech is quite literally just words. Words can't compare  to brutal crimes until they form actual threats, like ""I'll kill you""."
1.9.5.1.1.;Con:;Actually there are several forms of 'speech' that are recognized by the Supreme Court of the United States that are literally not words. Flag burning being one such example.
1.9.5.1.1.1.;Pro:;And as an example, burning the US flag to protest policy instituted by the government is not hateful, nor does it threaten any specific person. Where as Burning the Pride Flag could be used to threaten an LGBTQ person/community. \(Just as burning the flag to threaten Americans would be\)
1.9.6.;Pro:;A belief in free speech, must necessarily mean a belief that all speech is equally legitimate and deserving of protection.
1.9.6.1.;Con:;Literally nowhere in the world is this true.
1.9.6.2.;Con:;Speech is not equally legitimate or innocent in itself, for example when it consist of lies about someone, and as a consequence that person loses his or her job it is clearly more than just speech and one should be liable for lying.
1.9.6.2.1.;Con:;Liability and illegality are different. Liability is responsiblity, and can be determined after the fact. Legality is determined prior to any action.
1.9.6.2.1.1.;Pro:;For example, it is legal to leave a knife on your table.  You become liable when a child grabs that knife and cuts his/herself.
1.9.6.2.1.1.1.;Con:;The idea is the same. The argument in the knife/child example would be that the child should have been kept from the knife or the knife should have been kept from the child. In the lying example, the arguments run parallel. The lie should be kept from the public, or the public should be kept from the lie.
1.9.6.2.1.1.1.1.;Con:;Whether the lie should be kept from the public or the public from the lie, there is a large difference in declaring that no speaches may be given due to a risk of a lie and holding the lier accountable for the results of the lie.
1.9.6.2.1.1.1.1.1.;Con:;"That is not the point that was argued. The point was that Not all speech is equal or equally legitimate, such as the case where lies are spread to degrade or dehumanize a group of people for example. Saying ""all Catholics are pedophiles"" is incorrect and spreads a lie based on the fact that ""there have been numerous cases of pedophilia within the Catholic church""; the former being illegitimate and the form being fact."
1.9.6.2.2.;Pro:;Stating that all speech is equally legitimate would promote the idea that researched facts are as legitimate as conjecture or fiction.
1.9.6.2.2.1.;Con:;Statements are not necessarily facts and false statements from individuals or organizations can lead to permanent effects of said individual/organization's in regards to their views and future publications.
1.9.7.;Con:;Absolute freedom is not desirable because it necessarily infringes on the rights of others.
1.9.7.1.;Con:;We already have absolute freedom. It is our actions that have consequences. Infringing upon other peoples freedoms in order to prevent harm is overly assumptive, especially when it comes to speech.
1.9.7.1.1.;Con:;"In practice the law allows some people to infringe upon other people's freedom. It is accepted by the majority of people because they think that it is better for them \(for example: police can stop a robber in action\). If many people think that hate speech is harmful, it wouldn't be ""assumptive"" to limit it: it would be only the will of the majority."
1.9.7.1.1.1.;Con:;"The imposition of the will of a majority comes at the expense of a minority. \(Also referred to as ""[tyranny of the majority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyranny_of_the_majority).""\)"
1.9.7.1.1.1.1.;Pro:;Majority support of a policy will allow the largest number of people to benefit.
1.9.7.1.1.1.1.1.;Con:;Just because a group accepts a position doesn't mean mean that it will have the best outcome. \([Groupthink](https://yourbias.is/groupthink) bias.\)
1.9.7.2.;Con:;Moral standards may include some form of intolerance. Thereby, limiting freedom of speech would also limit freedom of religion.
1.9.7.3.;Con:;Speech does not have the capability to infringe upon rights. Actions infringe upon rights.
1.9.7.4.;Pro:;It makes sense to limit people's freedom to perform particular actions \(e.g. violence\) in order to protect other people's freedom from such actions \(the right to be free from violence\).
1.9.7.5.;Pro:;Society can only exist when individuals agree to trade off some freedoms in return for the ability to co-exist peacefully.
1.9.7.6.;Pro:;Hate speech relies on the idea that not all people are created equal and therefore cannot be legally protected.
1.10.;Pro:;-> See 1.7.4.
1.11.;Pro:;Making hate speech illegal sets a dangerous precedent, which could lead to curtailment of all speech.
1.11.1.;Pro:;Someone has to decide what constitutes hate-speech. Even with the best intentions this may lead to a bias, and with bad intentions this may lead to hate-speech laws being used to disproportionally silence specific ideas.
1.11.1.1.;Pro:;-> See 1.2.11.2.
1.11.1.2.;Pro:;A persons personal views \(bias\) filter what another says and can take away a message the speaker was not saying or twist the message. [youtube.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WMuzhQXJoY&t=791s)
1.11.1.3.;Con:;"All actions \(especially hate speech\) have bias. Hate speech laws intentionally seek to silence ideas; ideas which seek to dehumanize, degrade, or exterminate innocent people"
1.11.1.4.;Con:;-> See 1.2.11.2.1.6.
1.11.1.5.;Pro:;Hate speech cannot be properly determined, thus a law around hate speech could be abused by all sides.
1.11.2.;Con:;Saying legitimate free speech indicates that there are prohibited arenas of speech.
1.11.2.1.;Con:;To say some speech is socially unacceptable does not mean it should be outlawed. If you grant the power to regulate some speech that power may be used against you if someone finds your speech offensive.
1.11.2.2.;Pro:;-> See 1.9.6.
1.11.3.;Con:;"There are [many countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hate_speech#Hate_speech_laws_by_country) where hate speech is illegal, but this has not led to any significant downsides in public deliberations or ""curbs on legitimate free speech‚Äú."
1.11.3.1.;Con:;Count Dankula's case is an example of how laws that limit free speech can include even jokes when interpreted too broadly. [en.m.wikipedia.org](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Meechan)
1.11.3.2.;Con:;Russia has hate speech laws and [has been widely criticized for infringing on freedom of speech.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Media_freedom_in_Russia)
1.11.3.2.1.;Con:;Just because a country bans hate speech and has not expressed freedom, that does not mean there's a causal relation.
1.11.3.2.2.;Con:;These countries \(Russia/North Korea\) have banned freedom of expression, not just hate speech. Therefore, they shouldn't count as examples.
1.11.3.2.2.1.;Pro:;There is a large grey area between 'hate speech' and 'freedom of expression'. North Korea and Russian governments could easily claim that allowing people to publish anti-government articles is 'hate speech' because it is inciting hatred towards a particular group \(the government\) without justification \(in their opinion\).
1.11.3.2.2.1.1.;Con:;In Russia a university was closed in retaliation for election monitoring by corrupt officials. Its [licence was suspended in 2008 for 'fire safety'](https://www.opendemocracy.net/od-russia/dmitry-dubrovsky/closure-of-european-university-at-st-petersburg-dead-cert) due to, in part, a ‚Äúpreviously unnoticed‚Äù cast iron staircase built in 1881. In 2018 it was again closed
